Looking for a simple example of a Rust server-side proxy with CORS included? Look no further!

This project is built on Actix-web and includes actix-cors with placeholder variables to get you up and running ASAP.

It even removes the typical hassle of OpenSSL (in)compatibility by solely focusing on Rustls!

Check out the git for examples and configuration options.
